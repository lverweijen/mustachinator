This program draws a mustache on an image, video or webcam stream.
It should theoretically work on all platforms but has only been tested on
linux.

It has been developed on a platform with the following packages installed.
- OpenCV 2.3
- Python 2.7
- python-numpy 1.6

Instructions for installing opencv can be found on:
http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide
Make sure to compile with python bindings.

Here are shortcuts when using mustachinator with a camera:
    (space) - toggle pause
    q       - quit
    d       - toggle debug mode
    m       - toggle mustache
    b       - toggle black mustache
    r       - reset

The code is divided over the files as follows:
    mustachinator - frontend
    mustache.py - all recognizing stuff
    shapes.py - helper class containg geometric shapes
    filter.py - contains the Kalman filter

Test data can be found on http://www.vision.caltech.edu/html-Ô¨Åles/.
